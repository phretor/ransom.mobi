<p>This ransomware family first appeared in May 2014 and it blocks the screen of an infected device and requests a ransom between $100 and $300 in order to unlock the device. This request is sent through a localized message from the "police".</p>
<p>However, ransomwares belonging to this family do not encrypt any files or perform any kind of advanced blocking of the target device other than blocking the screen.</p>
