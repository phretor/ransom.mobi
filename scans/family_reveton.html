<h2>Reveton</h2>
<p>This ransomware family is one of the oldest and is an Android porting of the desktop version.</p>
<p>Even if in the ransom message it claims to encrypt all the files, it does not have the permissions to perform encrypting. These malwares are only able to show the ransom request message and to send to a remote C&amp;C server some sensitive data such as the IMEI code. Since they do not request for Device Administrator rights, it is quite easy to uninstall them from the device.</p>
