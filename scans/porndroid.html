        <h2>PornDroid</h2>
<p>This family has been discovered in late 2014 and has been updated during 2015 to add new features.</p>
<p>It is mainly available as a porn-related application (usually called "PornDroid") and it does not perform encryption, but locks the device (newer versions set a new randomw unlock pin). Please note that since the new pin is created randomly, neither the user nor the attacker know it, so paying the ransom is useless in terms of device unlocking.</p>
<p>As the majority of ransomwares, it shows a ransom request through a fake FBI message, and the amount to pay is usually between $300 and $500.</p>
<p>Moreover newer versions are able to hide the Device Administrator grant dialog by superimposing a fake update screen and can detect if some anti-virus software is running on the device and stop it.</p>
